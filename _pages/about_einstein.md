I'm Ş. Kaan Alkır, a Mathematics graduate student at Bilkent University. My research is mostly on reinforcement learning and mean-field games, with a focus on theoretical aspects of AI. I finished my bachelor's degree at Ankara University and currently work as a teaching and research assistant. I enjoy working on problems that combine probability, optimization, and learning theory. Right now, I’m preparing for a PhD, aiming to explore deeper ideas in AI from a mathematical perspective.
