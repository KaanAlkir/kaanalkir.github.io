I'm a mathematics MSc student at Bilkent University and an academic assistant working on Reinforcement Learning, Mean-Field Games, and AI Theory. My research involves combining theoretical models with practical algorithms in decision-making under uncertainty.

I completed my Bachelor's degree at Ankara University and have contributed to multiple academic projects and teaching efforts. Currently, I am preparing for a PhD in artificial intelligence, with a strong focus on mathematical modeling.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests

- Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
- Mean-Field Games and control
- Kernel methods in AI
- Variational optimization
- Quantum computing (curiosity-driven)
