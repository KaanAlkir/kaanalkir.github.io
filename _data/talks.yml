  title: "Reinforcement Learning for Mean-field Games with Average Reward Criterion"
  venue: "Analysis Seminar, Bilkent University"
  abstract: >
    We study the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem for discrete-time, infinite-horizon mean-field games (MFG) with an average-reward criterion. Unlike the forward setting, where the reward function is known, IRL assumes access only to expert demonstrations that are optimal under some unknown reward function. The objective is to recover the reward structure that explains these expert behaviors. Our approach is based on the maximum causal entropy principle, which selects the least biased policy among those consistent with the observed demonstrations. We show that the resulting non-convex formulation is equivalently reformulated as a convex optimization problem over occupation measures. Furthermore, we establish that the dual objective is smooth and strongly convex over compact sets and derive a variational representation using a log-partition formulation. Finally, we propose a first-order algorithm for solving the dual problem and recovering an entropy-maximizing equilibrium policy.

  title: "Grover’s Search Algorithm"
  abstract: >             # “>” starts a folded block
    This presentation introduces Grover’s Search Algorithm, a
    cornerstone quantum algorithm that offers a quadratic
    speedup over classical linear search methods. We begin by
    formulating the unstructured search problem and analyzing
    the inefficiencies of classical approaches. Grover’s
    algorithm is then developed step-by-step, highlighting its
    initialization through Hadamard gates, the iterative
    amplitude amplification process using oracle and diffusion
    operators, and the final measurement phase. Key concepts
    such as the geometric interpretation in the
    $|\omega\rangle - |\omega^{\perp}\rangle$ plane and
    complexity analysis are also discussed. The algorithm’s
    runtime of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ demonstrates the significant
    advantage of quantum computation in search problems.
